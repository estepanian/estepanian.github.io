				A highly energetic, attentive and enthusiastic 22-year-old learner with a fresh, eclectic perspective coupled with industry experience playing a myriad of different roles. Having gained experience and knowledge from both traditional schooling, participating in the education others and extensive involvement in the business world, I have built my way up to being able to identify and engineer complex, secure and interactive technology solutions alone, as my own company. As a performing musician and music producer and educator, my nature is to weave my love for communication, learning and technology. My passion for art and computers spills over to create work that is deeply functional, human and expressive.

				<span>EDUCATION</span>

			<div class="col-right">
				<span>I attended Oakland University in pursuit of a bachelor's degree in computer science from 2014 to 2017, all the while maintaining a full course load and at least part-time employment status within the tech industry. I must say, I'd estimate that most of what I've learned in the past four years about business, technology, communication and cooperation have come from things I've experienced in accordance with personal or business pursuits with only roughly 5% in accordance with the university. I felt, at the time that the technologies and concepts that my undergraduate courses were focused on were bland and outdated; this coupled with my already strong and growing affinity for a more "hands on" approach to software development (and learning, in general) led me to withdraw from classes to pursue full-time employment within the world of software development. I don't regret this decision a bit and look forward to pursuing education (formal and otherwise) whenever life permits it.</span>
